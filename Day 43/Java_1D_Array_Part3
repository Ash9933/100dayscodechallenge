Problem - Write a program in java to store a collection of data in a contiguous block of memory.
          Each element in the collection is accessed using an index and the elements are easy to
          find because they're stored sequentially.
          
Code:

import java.util.*;

public class Solution {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
	   
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scan.nextInt();
				
        int a[] = new int[n];
        int count = 0;
        while(scan.hasNextInt()){
            a[count++] = scan.nextInt(); // Increase count by 1 after assignment
        }

        scan.close();

        // Prints each sequential element in array a
        for (int i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
            System.out.println(a[i]);
        }
    }
}


Input:

5
10
20
30
40
50

Output:

10
20
30
40
50

Explanation - In this challenge we reads an integer from stdin and saves it to a variable, n ,denoting some number of integers.
              We are creating an array, a , capable of holding n integers.The first line contains a single integer, n , denoting
              the size of the array.Each line i of the n subsequent lines contains a single integer denoting the value of element ai.
              
              And,in the output format we are not responsible for printing any output to stdout.In it locked code in the loops
              through array a  prints each sequential element on a new line.
              
              When we save each integer to its corresponding index in a , we get  a=[10,20,30,40,50].And,the locked code prints each
              array element on a new line from left to right.
