Problem- Write a program in java which takes input as a string and split the strings into tokens
         Token to be one or more consecutive English alphabetic letters. Then, print the number
         of tokens, followed by each token on a new line.
         
Code:

import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        String s = scan.nextLine();
             s = s.trim();

     if(s.length()<=0){
         System.out.println(0);
         return;

     }else{
          String[] tokens = s.split("[ ?._'@!,]+");
            System.out.println(tokens.length);
                 for(String x : tokens){
                     System.out.println(x);
                    }
        }

}
    
        
    }

Sample input1- He is a very very good boy, isn't he?

Sam[le output- 10
               He
               is
               a
               very
               very
               good
               boy
               isn
               t
               he

Explanation- In this challenge we consider a token to be a contiguous segment of alphabetic characters.
             There are a total of 10 tokens in string 's' and each token is printed in the same order
             in which it appears in string 's'.
