Problem - Write a java program to input array sort them in descending order each number must be printed in
          the exact same format as it was read from stdin, meaning that .1 is printed as .1 and 0.1 is printed as 0.1 
          If two numbers represent numerically equivalent values code must be listed in the same order.
          
Code:

     import java.math.BigDecimal;
import java.util.*;
class Solution{

    public static void main(String []args){
        //Input
        Scanner sc= new Scanner(System.in);
        int n=sc.nextInt();
        String []s=new String[n+2];
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            s[i]=sc.next();
        }
      	sc.close();
          Comparator myComparator = new Comparator(){

        @Override
        public int compare(Object o1, Object o2) {
            BigDecimal a = new BigDecimal(String.valueOf(o1));
            BigDecimal b = new BigDecimal(String.valueOf(o2));
            return b.compareTo(a);
        }
    };
    Arrays.sort(s,0,n,myComparator);
    
        //Output
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        {
            System.out.println(s[i]);
        }
    }

}

Sample Input - 9
              -100
               50
               0
               56.6
               90
               0.12
               .12
               02.34
               000.000
               
Sample Output - 90
                56.6
                50
                02.34
                0.12
                 .12
                0
                000.000
                -100
                
Explanation - In this challenge we take an array and we are sorting it in descending order and each number must be printed in
              the exact same format as it was read from stdin. In this we are using Java's BigDecimal class and it can handle
              arbitrary-precision signed decimal numbers and we are listing in the same order as the  input was received .
