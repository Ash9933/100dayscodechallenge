Problem-In this program we have to find area of the give scenario.

Code:
     package d2009;

 abstract class Shape {
abstract float area(int x,int y);
}
class rect extends Shape{
    
    /* (non-Javadoc)
     * @see d2009.Shape#area(int, int)
     */
    float area(int x,int y)
    {
        return(x*y);
    }

}  

Input- We are taking input as 'x' and 'y'.

Outut- Output is calculated by multiplying 'x'and'y'.

Example-   x=4cm  and  y=8cm
 Now,   Area=32cm^2.
 
 Explanation- In this program we are using 'area' method find area of give length
              and breadth.
