Problem- Write a Java program to print the given string to its substring consisting of all characters in the inclusive
          range from 'n' to 'n-1'. You'll find the String class' substring method helpful in completing this challenge.
          
Code- import java.io.*;
      import java.util.*;
      import java.text.*;
      import java.math.*;
      import java.util.regex.*;

        public class Solution {

          public static void main(String[] args) {
            Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
            String S = in.next();
            int start = in.nextInt();
            int end = in.nextInt();
            System.out.println(S.substring(start, end));
      }
   } 
   
Input- Helloworld
       3 7
       
Output- lowo

Explanation- By this program we conclude that we are making the sustring from the given string,which index
             start with 0 and ends upto n-1.
             
             Like- 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
                   H e l l o w o r l d
         
        As given range starts from 3 and goes upto 7-1 means 6.
        It shows the element from index 3 to 6.
