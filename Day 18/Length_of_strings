Problem- Write a program in java to find the length of inputed string in first line, compare  lexographically the size of
         string if string A is greater print 'Yes' else print 'No' in second line and the whole string in third line.

Code:
      import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        String A=sc.next();
        String B=sc.next();
        /* Enter your code here. Print output to STDOUT. */
          int sum = A.length() + B.length();
    System.out.println(sum);
    if(A.compareTo(B)>0) System.out.println("Yes");
    else System.out.println("No");

    System.out.print(A.substring(0, 1).toUpperCase()+A.substring(1));
     System.out.print(" "); 
    System.out.print(B.substring(0, 1).toUpperCase()+B.substring(1)); 


}

        
    }

Input-hello
      java
      
Output-9
       No
       Hello Java      

Explanation- String A is "hello" and B is "java".
             A has a length of 5 , and B has a length of 4 ; the sum of their lengths is 9 .
             When sorted alphabetically/lexicographically, "hello" precedes "java"; therefore ,
             A is not greater than B and the answer is No.
             When we capitalize the first letter of both A and B and then print them separated
             by a space, we get "Hello Java".
