Problem - Write a code in java that takes input as a string and check the
          sequence of characters which reads the same backward or forward.
          
Code- import java.io.*;
      import java.util.*;

   public class Solution {

      public static void main(String[] args) {
        
         Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
          String A=sc.next();
          /* Enter your code here. Print output to STDOUT. */
          char firstCharacter = A.charAt(0);
        char lastCharacter = A.charAt(A.length() - 1);

        if (firstCharacter == lastCharacter) {
          System.out.println("Yes");
    }  else {
        System.out.println("No");
    }
    }
}


Sample Input0- Madam

Sample Output0- Yes

Sample Input1- Sir

Sample Output- No


Explanation- In this program we are taking strings as input as checking wether the alphabets of the string is same at first 
             and last .If the alphabets are same then print 'Yes' otherwise it will print 'No'.As given in sample output
             we take 'Madam' and it is printing 'Yes' and in the other hand we are taking 'Sir' it will printing 'No'.
