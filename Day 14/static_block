Problem- Write a code in which initialization blocks are executed when the class is loaded,
         and we have to initialize static variables in those blocks.
         
Code:
     import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;
import java.text.*;
import java.math.*;
import java.util.regex.*;

public class Solution {

static Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
static int B = scan.nextInt();
static int H = scan.nextInt();
static boolean flag = true;
static{
    try{
        if(B <= 0 || H <= 0){
            flag = false;
            throw new Exception("Breadth and height must be positive");
        }
    }catch(Exception e){
        System.out.println(e);
    }

}


public static void main(String[] args){
		if(flag){
			int area=B*H;
			System.out.print(area);
		}
		
	}//end of main

}//end of class

Input-There are two lines of input. The first line contains B: the breadth of the parallelogram.
      The next line contains H : the height of the parallelogram.
      
Output- If both values are greater than zero, then the main method must output
        the area of the parallelogram. Otherwise, print "java.lang.Exception:
         Breadth and height must be positive" without quotes.
         
Explanation- In this program we are using exception in which we take two lines
             First line is for the breadth and second line is for length.
