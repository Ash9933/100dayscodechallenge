Problem- Write a java program to input n pairs of string and take each pair as input,we need to print number
         of unique pairs we currently have.
         
Code :

import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;
import java.text.*;
import java.math.*;
import java.util.regex.*;

public class Solution {

 public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);
        int t = s.nextInt();
        String [] pair_left = new String[t];
        String [] pair_right = new String[t];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < t; i++) {
            pair_left[i] = s.next();
            pair_right[i] = s.next();
        }
 Set<String> out= new HashSet<>();
    for(int i=0;i<t;i++){
        String n = pair_left[i]+"_"+pair_right[i];
        out.add(n);
        System.out.println(out.size());
        
    }
    

    }
}

Input:

5
john tom
john mary
john tom
mary anna
mary anna

Output:

1
2
2
3
3


Explanation - In the first line, there will be an integer T denoting number of pairs. Each of the next T
              lines will contain two strings seperated by a single space.
              
              After taking the first input, we have only one pair: (john,tom)
              
              After taking the second input,we have two pairs: (john, tom) and (john, mary)
              
              After taking the third input,we still have two unique pairs.
              
              After taking the fourth input,we have three unique pairs: (john,tom), (john, mary) and (mary, anna)
              
              After taking the fifth input,we still have three unique pairs.
              
              Lastly Print T lines. In the ith line, print number of unique pairs you have after taking ith pair as input.
