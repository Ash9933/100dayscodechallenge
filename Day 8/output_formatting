Problem- The purpose of this exercise is to test of formatting output using printf.
         Every line of input will contain a String followed by an integer.
         
Code:
     import java.util.Scanner;

public class Solution {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
            Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
            System.out.println("================================");
            for(int i=0;i<3;i++){
                String s1=sc.next();
                int x=sc.nextInt();
                System.out.printf("%-15s%03d%n",s1,x); 

                //Complete this line
            }
            System.out.println("================================");

    }
}

Input- Each String will have a maximum of 10 alphabetic characters, and each integer
       will be in the inclusive range from 0 to 999.
       
Output-The first column contains the String and is left contains 15 characters.
       The second column contains the integer, if the original
       input has less than three digits.

Explanation - By implementing this code Each String is left-justified with trailing
              whitespace through the first 15 characters. The leading digit of the integer
              is the 16th character, and each integer that was less than  digits now has 
              leading zeroes.
