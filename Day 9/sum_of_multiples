Problem-In this challenge we are going to find multiples of given numbers which 
        is in given range and finding its sum.
        
Code:
     package d2009;

      public class multiples {
        static int find_sum(int N)
        {
            int sum = 0;
            for(int i = 0; i < N; i++)
                if(i%3 == 0 || i%5 == 0)
                    sum += i;
            return sum;                
        }
    
        public static void main (String[] args) 
        {
            int N = 15;
            int sum = find_sum(N);
            System.out.println(sum);
        }
    }  
 
 Input-In this program we have taken 3 and 5 and finding its multiples upto 15(except 15)
      which are same
      
Output- Now multiples of 3 upto 20= 3,6,9,12
        and multiples of 5 upto 20= 5,10
 Now,  Sum =45
 
 Explanation- In this program we first find the multiples of given numbers as shown.
               And,then calculate the sum of given multiples
